This is a set of demos for ATS-EcoSIM code

Currently there demos for testing the coupler under realistic daymet climate forcing for ~ 5 years in both a single column, and hillslope configuration.

These also include simple observation files that track the fluxes passed between EcoSIM and ATS and also tracks the snow height.
